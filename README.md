## Projects
### Encoding, Decoding, and Manifold Nonlinearity Analysis of Mouse Motor Cortex and Thalamus
[Bernstein Conference 2023 Poster](https://github.com/flanneryjn/portfolio/blob/main/assets/Poster9_27.pdf)

Created encoding kernels for motor activity and sensory stimulation using rank regression in **Python**, decoded activity times for motor neurons, and used PCA vs nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods to characterize the neural manifold.

### fMRI Feature Extraction with Graph Networks and Lightweight-Convolutional Neural Networks
[Github](https://github.com/brain-tools/rfmri-feature-extraction/blob/master/readme.md)
[Project Update Report](https://github.com/flanneryjn/portfolio/blob/main/assets/Ritter_Lab_Report_latex.pdf)

Extracted features from fMRI with a sophisticated **Python** pipeline using different a) brain atlases (Brainnetome, Schaefer, and UKBiobank's Melodic-ICA Atlas) and b) methods (functional connectivity, anatomical features, lightweight CNNs, graph networks) in order to perform a scaling analysis and make recommendations on the usefulness of differing atlases and feature extraction methods.

### Safe Reinforcement Learning with CRABS
[Blog Post](https://lars-chen.github.io/rl-blog/learning-barrier-certificates/)
[Github](https://github.com/flanneryjn/CRABS_RL?tab=readme-ov-file)

Ran 3-D physics simulations using **Pytorch and Mujoco** to explore how a new reinforcement learning method reacts to higher dimensional input spaces.

## Work Experience
**Masters Lab Rotation Work and Thesis @ Charité University Medicine (_Dec 2023 - Present_)**
- Created a python tool to automate graph feature extraction from fMRI datasets both with an anatomical brain-atlas and an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) brain-atlas. Used convolutional neural networks for target variable prediction on brain data. Coded in Python, with PyTorch.
- Analyzed extracellular spikes in mouse brain, looking at 1) behavioral decoding 2) behavioral encoding kernels and 3) nonlinearity of neural manifold in different brain regions. Presented as a poster at the Bernstein Conference 2023. Also trained on biological surgical procedures for wet lab work. Coded in Python.


**Data Analyst @ University of Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries (_Feb 2019 - Aug 2021_)**
- Research: I published work and presented at conferences work I completed alone and also in collaborations. Most notably, I applied state of the art image-to-text reading and natural language processing (BERT) to generate summaries for the library's new pamphlet collection, which was so far undocumented. I published this research in 2020. In a collaboration with the biology department, I worked with epidemiological forecasting and with ArcGIS analysis for forest and soil analysis.
- Reporting: I served stakeholders inside and outside the library by providing them speedy reporting when requested, and also maintained weekly reporting on various library statistics and played a key part in yearly audit reporting. I often curated ad-hoc reporting with insights and visuals from Tableau, or in Python when custom visuals were requested.
- Data curation: I worked on a task force that cleaned and curated library data, improving records using a plethora of methods, sometimes through simple SQL work, sometimes writing web crawlers to check links are functional, sometimes through writing more complex Python code for systematic cleaning.

**ESL Assistant Teacher @ Carmen Conde Bilingual Primary School - Leganés (_Oct 2017 - Jul 2018_)**
- Taught ESL both in lectures to classrooms and tutoring small groups of higher need students, primarily teaching 2nd grade where both English and Science are taught in English

**Math Researcher (Undergrad REU) - University of California, Los Angeles (_Jun 2017 - Aug 2017_)**
- Project done in conjunction with Los Alamos National Labs and presented both on site in national labs and via webcast
- Used graph theory to model molecules in ways that best preserve structure when materials (generally periodic nano-particles) are heated and cooled
- First researched and applied already-existing geometric models (ex. Voronoi Construction) before designing new systems with **Matlab and Java**

**Software Developer Intern - Walmart (_Jun 2016 - Aug 2016_)**
- Launched a new web application, streamlining creation of brochures for all Walmart stores, using **Java, SQL, and C#**
- Included integrating within existing codebase, taking from and reading user uploaded MSFT office files, reading from and updating existing tables within app

**Software Developer Intern - Amazon.com (_May 2015 - Aug 2015_)**
- Created an algorithm to link brands in Amazon’s Catalog between marketplaces, tuned it with stats/ML, and integrated code within Amazon’s massive Brand Catalog codebase
- Java, R, PostgreSQL (columnar, noSQL)
