## Projects
### Encoding, Decoding, and Manifold Nonlinearity Analysis of Mouse Motor Cortex and Thalamus
[Bernstein Conference 2023 Poster](https://github.com/flanneryjn/portfolio/blob/main/assets/Poster9_27.pdf)

Created encoding kernels for motor activity and sensory stimulation using rank regression in **Python**, decoded activity times for motor neurons, and used PCA vs nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods to characterize the neural manifold.

### fMRI Feature Extraction with Graph Networks and Lightweight-Convolutional Neural Networks
[Github](https://github.com/brain-tools/rfmri-feature-extraction/blob/master/readme.md)
[Project Update Report](https://github.com/flanneryjn/portfolio/blob/main/assets/Ritter_Lab_Report_latex.pdf)

Extracted features from fMRI with a sophisticated **Python** pipeline using different a) brain atlases (Brainnetome, Schaefer, and UKBiobank's Melodic-ICA Atlas) and b) methods (functional connectivity, anatomical features, lightweight CNNs, graph networks) in order to perform a scaling analysis and make recommendations on the usefulness of differing atlases and feature extraction methods.

### Safe Reinforcement Learning with CRABS
[Blog Post](https://lars-chen.github.io/rl-blog/learning-barrier-certificates/)
[Github](https://github.com/flanneryjn/CRABS_RL?tab=readme-ov-file)

Ran 3-D physics simulations using **Pytorch and Mujoco** to explore how a new reinforcement learning method reacts to higher dimensional input spaces.
